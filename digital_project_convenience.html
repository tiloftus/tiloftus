  		<h1>How Biking Can Save Boston- Convenience</h1>

		<p>	Are you tired of waiting for buses, trains, and subways? Do you get annoyed at traffic? I guarantee everyone in Boston would answer yes to at least one of those questions. As thousands of citizens use run-down and expensive public transportation systems and others sit in stand-still traffic, bikers speed by. Biking has the potential to speed up commutes significantly. Furthermore, some aspects that deter people from biking have actually been resolved in recent years. While the costs of purchasing and maintaining a bike used to be obstacles, bike-sharing programs have removed that barrier. Boston's own program, Bluebikes, allows riders to grab a Bluebike at any of the frequent stations and drive it at a low cost. Users can grab a bike for a single-use trip or subscribe to the service for unlimited rides. On this site you can see a map of Bluebikes stations in Boston. <br> <br>
