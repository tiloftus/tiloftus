                <p>Biking is a safe, environmentally-friendly, fun, and convenient method of transportation that is hardly used in Boston. <br> <br>
				
				The ways people get around cities have a massive effect on life in the city. Cars, which an overwhelming majority of citizens use, have several downsides related to environment, health, safety, and general public life in the city. Boston, like many American cities, is a car-heavy area. But the city has, in recent years, favored biking with their infrastructural decisions. Biking brings many benefits as opposed to cars, and it's in Boston's best interests to have as many bikers as possible. <br> <br>
