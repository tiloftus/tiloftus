		<p>	Biking is beneficial to public health, both mental and physical. Those who bike regularly are at a lower risk of heart disease (Sadik-Khan, 2017). Bike rides reduce stress and anxiety, and can burn as many as 600 calories per hour (Alves, 2022). Yet an overwhelming majority of Americans commute to work via car (Sadik-Khan, 2017), missing out on these potential benefits. A world with more biking would likely lead to a happier and healthier population, yet cars are still the primary way people get around in the city. Car and motor vehicle crashes also account for 1.25 million deaths annually, and traffic death is the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 15 and 29 (Sadik-Khan, 2017). Itâ€™s in the interest of any governing body to promote public health in any way possible, and many cities have found that investments that entice people to bike are investments in public health. </p>
